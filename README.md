# Karger Algorithme
  Karger's algorithm is a randomized algorithm to compute a minimum cut of a connected graph. The purpose of the project is to test different variant of this algorithm and  bench the accuracy and execution time.
### Rust programming language

Choosing the rust programming language, is a personal decision to test  how the language behave in high level and abstracted problematics (The functional part is interesting in these cases)
